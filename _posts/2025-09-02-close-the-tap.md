We keep pretending this is about a few bad contractors. It isn't. The "ghost projects" in flood control are what you get when politics designs the pipeline and paper moves money faster than concrete ever will. That's why, as both chambers drag flood control into the spotlight, you're seeing the same pattern of hearings filled with absences and subpoenas, district engineers on the hot seat and a public that's furious because the water keeps rising while a tiny circle gets richer.

This is not conjecture. The Senate's blue ribbon has opened a *motu proprio* probe, the infrastructure committee of the House started its own hearing today, and even Malaca√±an is signalling a full-court press. When a contractor turns up to the Senate and invokes the right against self-incrimination, and the President talks about substandard and non-existent projects, you know the rot isn't anecdotal.

Public anger isn't abstract either. [The Bureau of Customs has said](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/957203/customs-to-probe-discaya-couple-s-40-luxury-cars/story/) it will examine a contractor couple's reported stable of luxury cars (the same couple whose firm cornered flood control deals) and senators have already issued subpoenas to firms that snubbed the first hearing. Families in waist-deep water watching Instagram tours of garages is the worst possible optics. That spectacle would be bad enough if the work were late or shoddy. It's unforgivable if the work never existed.

Here's the uncomfortable part: the incentives make this easy. For years, DPWH has leaned on geotagged photo monitoring to document progress, but images without trust anchors are easy to spoof. There's a department order prescribing geotagging and a manual to guide it, yet anyone who has ever managed field verification knows photos can be staged or recycled unless you harden the capture and randomise checks. Today's hearings underlined a bigger weakness: [a Bulacan district engineer admitted](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1257863) issuing completion certificates without personally inspecting the works, which is precisely how a ghost earns a government cheque. The Commission on Audit is now running a fraud and performance audit with technical inspections starting in Bulacan. Better late than never, but "after the fact" is not a control.

If you want a comparative lens, look at how others block the money until the work is real. In the United States, federal construction sits under the Miller Act. Performance and payment bonds are the price of admission on most jobs, so a surety with skin in the game vets your capacity and stands ready to finish if you fail. That, alone, makes pure phantoms hard. Then come the quality gates: on federal-aid highways, you don't get paid on affidavits; you get paid after independent acceptance and assurance testing under 23 CFR 637. Finally, the blacklist actually bites: contracting officers must check the government-wide exclusion system before award. Europe runs a similar playbook with procurement directives that force transparency and competition, and a union-wide exclusion database called EDES for EU-budget funds. None of this makes fraud impossible; it just makes it very hard to invoice for nothing.

By contrast, the Philippines is still catching up on practice even as the law has moved. The New Government Procurement Act (R.A. 12009) revises the old regime and nods to open government, beneficial ownership and fit-for-purpose tools. PhilGEPS has open-data commitments under the Open Government Partnership. But data in PDFs and dashboards that no one can interrogate at scale are not the same as publishing a machine-readable trail from plan to payment. We are better on paper than we are on prevention.

If you want the economic stakes, [the finance chief told senators](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3324031/philippines-lost-us2-billion-2-years-flood-corruption-finance-secretary) as much as 70 percent of funds may have been lost to "ghost and poor-quality projects" over two years or roughly US$2 billion. That's 30 to 45 thousand classrooms or one hot lunch for every school child for the next 220 days that we didn't buy. [GMA's own tally](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/954195/nearly-p1-trillion-allotted-for-flood-control-projects-from-2023-2025/story/) has nearly one trillion pesos poured into flood control from 2023 to 2025. These are not rounding errors; they are the difference between a dry classroom and a cancelled week of school.

People are furious at the spectacle of contractors and political families flaunting wealth while households wade through brown water. They should be. But anger must now be converted into design changes that make theft unprofitable and failure visible before money leaves the Treasury. Otherwise we will hold hearings every monsoon season and learn nothing new except the latest number of zeroes.

So what do we do that actually changes outcomes before the next storm? Start with a rule so simple even a cynic can remember it: no test, no pay. Progress billings clear only after third-party labs verify materials, as-built surveys confirm dimensions, and an independent assurance regime signs off on a randomised sample. This is standard practice in the US highway system; it can be standard here by circular within weeks. The honest contractor already meets it.

Next, bring surety discipline to civil works above a modest threshold. Require performance and payment bonds from reputable sureties, and track surety performance the way we should track contractors. If a surety repeatedly pays out on duds, it sits out. The point is to put someone with real money at risk before taxpayers are.

Then fix the blacklist so it actually prevents recurrence. We already have blacklisting rules but enforcement is fragmented and the data are not universally wired into award and payment systems. Build a single, API-queriable exclusion list tied to PhilGEPS and Treasury so that entities, beneficial owners and even chronic underperforming sureties trigger an automatic stop at bid, award and disbursement. That's how SAM.gov and EDES protect their ecosystems.

Make the photos honest. Keep the DPWH geotag requirement, but add device attestation, tamper-evident hashes and truly random on-site checks triggered by anomaly detection. Cross-verify a risk-weighted sample with satellite or drone imagery. Don't just collect pictures; authenticate them.

Finally, publish the work so the public can see the difference between a ribbon and a result. Commit to the Open Contracting Data Standard across the contracting cycle (plan, tender, award, implement, pay) including location geometry, unit costs, change orders, test results and acceptance certificates. If the same kilometre of dike "appears" three times, journalists and citizens should be able to catch it before the Treasury does.

This is the politics of grown-ups. Stop treating the budget like a raffle where every district must "win" a culvert regardless of hydrology. Consolidate thousands of micro line-items into fewer, well-scoped packages that can be policed. If leaders cannot protect scarce funds from fakes while neighbourhoods bale out their living rooms, they should not ask for another term. And for the few who think a supercar collection is a clever flex during a flood, expect more than a public shaming: expect exclusions, audits and, where due, prosecutions.

There is a wiser country buried under the silt. We know how to build. We know what honest controls look like: bonds up front, tests before cash, blacklists that bite, data that travels. Implement these without theatrics and our children may finally step into a dry classroom after a heavy rain. Fail, and we'll keep buying lifeboats for ribbon-cuttings.

The tap is open. Close it.
