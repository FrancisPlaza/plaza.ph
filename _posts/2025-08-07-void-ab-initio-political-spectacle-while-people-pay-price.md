It's a familiar scene in Philippine politics: the halls of power packed with moral outrage, constitutional arguments and righteous speeches, all while the country quietly bleeds. The attempted impeachment of vice-president Sara Duterte is only the latest performance in our long-running political drama. But behind the legal jargon and televised soundbites lies a bitter truth—this isn't about justice, and it certainly isn't about the people.

The House of Representatives insists this is a matter of accountability. The vice-president's allies say it's all political vendetta. Both claim to be protecting democracy. Neither seems interested in protecting the Filipino public from the damage their infighting is causing.

Let's call this what it is: a proxy war for 2028, wrapped in legalese and waged at the people's expense.

This was never about the confidential funds. If it were, we'd see consistent scrutiny across all agencies, not just the one with Duterte on the nameplate. Nor is this a principled stand against the abuse of executive and legislative power, from congressional insertions to backdoor dealings masked as development. Many of those who sat comfortably through the last administration's abuses now cry foul over the vice-president's conduct, yet had no trouble looking the other way when the excesses were their own (or their cousin's). What changed? Only the colour of their alliances.

The Senate vote to archive the complaint, backed by a controversial Supreme Court ruling (now under a motion for reconsideration from the House) citing a violation of the one-year bar on impeachment, wasn't the end of anything. It was the opening act. In truth, the impeachment was dead on arrival. Everyone knew it. But still, it was filed. Still, it was debated. And still, it was performed—because performance is the point.

What was revealed wasn't just the end of a political alliance. That much has been obvious for some time. What this episode made clear is that the most pressing business of the Republic is not food security, not education reform, not economic recovery—but political survival.

In this chessboard of power, even former allies become dispensable. The House Speaker, once a key figure in the Marcos-Duterte alliance, now leads the charge against the vice-president. Senators, more cautious, hedge their bets. No one wants to offend a Duterte this early in the game, especially not one polling higher than any sitting official not named Duterte or Marcos.

What makes this moment so corrosive is not just the hypocrisy, but the casual indifference to consequence. While our leaders feud, inflation continues to outpace wages. Farmers go bankrupt waiting for rain or subsidies that never come. Children go hungry while schools lack chairs, books and teachers. The bureaucracy groans under the weight of inefficiency, yet its masters are too busy sharpening knives for the next political round.

We are told this is democracy in action. But real democracy listens to its people. Real democracy works. This, by contrast, is spectacle: loud, cynical and disconnected from the everyday grind of ordinary Filipinos.

And for what? So one dynasty can weaken another? So future candidacies can be shaped by today's betrayals?

The Marcos and Duterte names may dominate our politics today, but neither will outlive the damage this constant turmoil inflicts. These brands are temporary. The institutions they weaken, and the lives they fail to improve, will bear the scars for generations.

So, where do I stand in all of these? I am not in the middle because I fear taking sides. I am here because both sides have lost the plot. I am not calling for less accountability—I want more. I want the vice-president to answer for the funds. I want the Marcos-Romualdez camp to answer for theirs.

But I am also a realist. I know these calls will go nowhere. In a system where institutions serve power instead of checking it, accountability is selective, performative and short-lived. That's why I choose to stand not with the silence of indifference but with the clarity of disillusionment. Someone has to say: enough.

Enough of the theatrics.

Enough of the shadowboxing dressed up as statesmanship.

Enough of using institutions as weapons in a war the people never asked for.

The Filipino deserves more than a front-row seat to this political circus. They deserve a government that works. Until then, no impeachment, filed or archived, will cleanse the stench of self-interest that now pervades the air of public service.
