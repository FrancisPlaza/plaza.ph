Life is really short. That's something we all know, but often forget as we rush through our daily routines. Late at night, after long hours of meetings, when everything quiets down, the truth of it really sinks in. Suddenly, it feels real—life doesn’t go on forever.

Drawing from the wisdom of the stoics, I've learned to see this not just as a fact of life but as something that can push us to live better. Being stoic is about focusing on what's important: doing work that matters, spending time with loved ones and helping others. It teaches us to be present, to really live in the moment, and to throw ourselves into the things we care about.

Now that I’m in my 30's, I think more about how I might not even make it to 60. That's not being pessimistic; it's a wake-up call to make every day count. It reminds me to avoid falling prey to pointless activities—like too many unnecessary meetings or getting caught up in company politics that don’t really help anyone.

Instead, life being short tells us to focus on what truly matters. For me, that means building something worthwhile, being there for my friends and family, and making sure I’m not just busy, but productive. It’s about stripping away the stuff that doesn’t help us grow.

So, let’s not wait until a big shock reminds us that we don’t have forever. Let’s live our lives now with the urgency and passion they deserve. Let's make sure that when we look back, we can proudly say we really lived, not just existed. Let’s take every day as a chance to do something great, knowing it’s the best way to truly honour the time we have.
