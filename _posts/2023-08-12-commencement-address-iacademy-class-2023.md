Wow! Look at this crowd!

I must admit, I'm both thrilled and a tad bit nervous to be here this afternoon. Thank you, Ms Raquel Wong, for that incredibly kind introduction. I was half expecting some funny story from my past to pop up, so I'm relieved and grateful for your gracious words. Thank you; I am truly humbled.

Ms Vanessa Tanco, the dynamo behind iAcademy, your passion and dedication have transformed this institution into a powerhouse of innovation. I'm genuinely honoured to be here, and I promise to try and keep the tech jargon to a minimum!

To the relentless faculty and staff of iAcademy, you’ve done a phenomenal job. The proof? Just look at these graduates! They’re bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and ready to take on the world. And for that, you deserve a massive round of applause.

Now, to the real MVPs today—the parents, guardians and families. Your sacrifices, the sleepless nights, and yes, those tuition fees you had to pay—it's all led to this proud moment. I bet you're thinking, "Finally, a return on my investment!" But jokes aside, your unwavering support has been the bedrock of these young achievers. Your belief in your children's dreams has truly been the wind beneath their wings. You deserve a warm round of applause.

And of course, to the shining stars, the reason we're all here this afternoon, the iAcademy Class of 2023—a massive congratulations! Come on, give yourselves a roaring round of applause. You've earned it!

You know, standing here, I'm hit with a wave of nostalgia. Ten years ago, I was in your shoes, well, not literally—I doubt they'd fit. I was at my graduation at MIT, filled with dreams, a bit of anxiety and a whole lot of caffeine. The cap, the gown, the palpable excitement in the air—it feels like it was just yesterday. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be up here, giving a commencement speech. I mean, I was just hoping to land a decent job and maybe get a good night's sleep!

But here we are, and as I look at all of you, I can't help but feel a surge of excitement for the future. A future that's in your hands. A future where everyone gets a shot at finding their purpose. Now, I could stand here and give you the usual spiel about chasing your dreams, but let's be real—you've heard that before. I believe there's something deeper, something more profound to discuss. Today, I'm not just here to inspire you to build; I'm here to challenge you to build with intention, with a heart. I'll be sharing three stories from my own life, each a testament to the power of building things that truly matter. Not just to make a name, not just to fill a bank account, but to genuinely make a difference.

The first story is about finding ambition in humble beginnings.

Now imagine, if you will, the tranquil town of Sogod in the province of Southern Leyte. It's not Silicon Valley, but it's where my story begins. My family wasn't the kind you'd read about in success magazines. My father kept watch as a security guard, and my mom—she was the heartbeat of our local elementary school canteen. Between them, they taught me lessons no classroom ever could. They showed me the value of hard work, the importance of grit and the beauty of simple joys.

I never felt the weight of academic pressure on my shoulders. Instead, my education was a blend of school lessons and the wisdom found in the pages of Reader's Digests my dad would bring home. Those old magazines, acquired from friends, were my windows to a world beyond Sogod. They filled my young mind with tales of distant lands, ground-breaking discoveries and the indomitable human spirit.

In fifth grade, while my classmates aspired to be doctors, engineers and teachers, I penned down a dream that raised a few eyebrows: "I will become the President of the Philippines." It wasn't about the power or prestige. It was about making a difference, about dreaming beyond the confines of our small town and about believing that a kid from Sogod could one day lead a nation.

But it wasn't just these grand dreams that shaped me. It was the everyday realities, the struggles and the triumphs of my parents that truly molded my perspective. Watching them toil day in and day out, not for themselves, but for me, instilled a profound sense of purpose. Their sacrifices became my motivation. Their dreams for a better tomorrow became my mission. I realised that dreaming big wasn't just about lofty ambitions; it was about elevating the lives of those around you, about turning the impossible into the attainable.

After that audacious fifth-grade declaration, my journey took me to the halls of Pisay a few years later. Now, this wasn't just any school. It was a place where dreams were nurtured and young minds were molded. But what truly stuck with me wasn't a lesson from a textbook. There was this portion from our scholar's pledge, words that felt like they were written just for me: "I envision myself as creative, inventive and innovative, taking the lead in initiating positive changes that will enrich my school, my community and the Philippine society." Those words became my compass. They whispered in my ear that being inventive wasn't just for personal glory. It was about lifting everyone up around you, making a mark and leaving places better than you found them.

In the heart of that small town of Sogod, and the brick-laden walls of Pisay, amidst the challenges of limited means, I learned the most valuable lesson of all: that our circumstances don't define us, but our dreams and our drive do. And as I stand here today, I urge each one of you to remember this: No matter where you come from, no matter the odds stacked against you, always dare to dream bigger than your surroundings. Because in those dreams, fuelled by passion and hard work, lies the power to change not just your own destiny, but the world's.

And if a kid from Sogod can stand here today, just imagine where you can be tomorrow.

The second story is about failures and growth.

Now I feel so old saying this, but let’s rewind a bit to 2009. A fresh chapter of my life began, one that took me from the familiar terrains of Sogod to the illustrious corridors of the best university in the world, at MIT. I mean, for a boy from a small town, this was the stuff of dreams. But it wasn’t all romantic.

Imagine being 16 years old, taking an international flight for the first time, leaving behind everything familiar—family, friends and the comforts of home. I was stepping into a world renowned for its brilliance, with just my dreams and a suitcase.

My initial months at MIT were, to put it mildly, a humbling experience. Despite my background from the Philippine Science High School, I found myself grappling with subjects I was expected to excel in. The result was an unprecedented academic setback: failing both physics and calculus in my first term. This was not just a failure in subjects; it felt like a failure in meeting my own set of expectations.

But, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. MIT wasn't just about rigorous academics; it was a community. Recognising the need for change, I immersed myself in tutorial sessions, sought guidance from counsellors and collaborated more closely with my peers. I retook the subjects, and not only did I pass them, but I also got A’s in both.

Of course, MIT had more lessons in store. During an electronics lab, I made a careless oversight working with a microcontroller, inadvertently causing damage to a chip possibly worth thousands of dollars. As I stared at the smoky aftermath, I felt my heart sink.  As I confronted the magnitude of my error, my professor's response was both unexpected and enlightening. Instead of a reprimand, he offered perspective, saying, "Well, take this as a thousand-dollar lesson. Learn from it and go get another one."

This journey underscores a fundamental truth: our path to success is often punctuated with failures. But it's not the setbacks that define us; it's how we respond to them. Embracing mistakes as learning opportunities paves the way for growth and resilience.

We often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes. But here's the thing: mistakes, as painful as they are, are also our greatest teachers. They challenge us, mold us and, most importantly, they show us what we're made of.

Yet, the lessons from MIT were merely the prelude to a larger journey in the world of entrepreneurship. Before PayMongo became what it is today, there were other ventures I tried, some of which never saw the light of day. These early endeavours, while not successful in the traditional sense, were foundational. They were the training grounds where I learned the ropes of business, understanding that every setback was a lesson in disguise.

Building PayMongo was no walk in the park either. Behind the scenes of what many perceived as a meteoric rise were countless pitches, meetings and negotiations. I recall one evening after a particularly challenging investor meeting. The room, filled with the aroma of brewed coffee, echoed with scepticism. The journey of PayMongo, in those early days, was a path less travelled. For every nod of approval, there were countless rejections. But it's in these moments of doubt that true visions are tested.

One particular rejection still stands out today. After a long pitch, an investor leaned back, looked me straight in the eye, and said, “You have no background in finance.” I smiled, remembering Zuckerberg's words about being misunderstood. I replied, “That’s exactly why this will work.”

The road that led me to where I am today is not without lessons, not without stumbles. From MIT's rigorous exams to frying microcontrollers and navigating the unpredictable seas of entrepreneurship, every setback was a lesson, every “no” a steppingstone to the next “yes.”

So, to the Class of 2023, here's my two cents: Dream big, embrace the setbacks and remember, every challenge is just a chapter in your epic tale.

The third and final story is about building things that truly matter.

Every story has its symbols, its talismans. For me, it’s a simple sticker on a notebook I've had since college. It reads, "I will build things that matter." This isn't just a sticker; it's a compass, a guiding light. Even today, as I prepared to stand before you, I took a moment to glance at it, grounding myself in its message.

Fresh out of college, I found myself in one of the world's largest software companies. At just twenty, I was living what many would call ‘the dream’. A six-figure salary, a nice apartment and a sleek German car that purred its way to work every morning. To the outside world, I had it all. But as I sat in my cubicle, day in and day out, typing away lines of code, a nagging feeling settled in. Each line of code, while technically sound, felt hollow. I was building, yes, but was I truly making a difference? Or was I just another cog in a vast machine, furthering the ambitions of corporations while drifting away from my own mantra?

Seeking purpose, I traded the skyscrapers for the vibrant startup scene in Europe. The paycheck was smaller, I lived in a much smaller place and I took public transportation to work—but the role was vastly different. As one of the early software engineers in a budding startup, I wasn't just writing code; I was shaping experiences. Every line I wrote had a direct impact on our users. I wasn't just a software engineer; I was a problem solver, a creator and a direct contributor to our mission. The work was challenging, but it was fulfilling. Every day, I felt the tangible difference I was making.

I didn’t know it back then. But that short amount of time I spent working for a small startup in Europe eventually paved way to a wonderful career of leading my own company.

This journey taught me a profound lesson: Always anchor your dreams to your "why." It's easy to get swayed by the allure of comfort, by the shimmer of golden handcuffs. But true fulfilment, true success, lies in understanding and staying true to your purpose. When you build with purpose, not only does your work resonate deeper, but success, in all its forms, follows.

Four years. That's how long my team and I poured our hearts and souls into building PayMongo. From an idea to a force to be reckoned with, raising $50 million from top global investors and helping tens of thousands of Filipino entrepreneurs build their own success stories. We were on an upward trajectory, a rocket ship bound for the stars. But as is often the case with rapid ascents, turbulence is inevitable.

As we scaled new heights, shadows began to form. False narratives, malicious in intent, were crafted by those who perhaps felt threatened by our success or simply didn't share our vision. And within this whirlwind, I found myself working alongside individuals I had once believed would be pillars of our growth. But as time unfolded, it became clear that our paths were diverging.

November of last year marked a significant turning point. Just shy of my 30th birthday, I found myself parting ways with the very company I had birthed. The departure was public, and the weight of it was palpable. The company that had been my identity, my passion, was no longer a part of my daily life.

The weeks and months that followed were introspective. The sting of departure, the whispers of the industry, the void of not being at the helm of the company I started— it was a maelstrom of emotions. But amidst this storm, I realised something. Much like Steve Jobs, who, after his departure from Apple, realised he still loved what he did, I too feel an undying passion for building, for creating, for making a difference.

The weight of leadership, the pressures of being at the pinnacle, had been replaced by the refreshing lightness of starting anew. It was a return to my roots, to the very mantra that had guided me all these years: “I will build things that matter.”

Life will throw curveballs. There will be moments of doubt, periods of introspection and times when the world seems to be up against you. But remember this: Your purpose, your “why,” remains unchanged. Hold onto it, cherish it and let it guide you through the storms and into the dawn of new beginnings.

My dear graduates, as we journeyed together through my stories today, there's a singular thread that binds them all: the pursuit of purpose. From the humble streets of Sogod to the bustling boardrooms of Manila, from MIT’s rigorous classrooms to the dynamic world of startups, it's been a rollercoaster journey of building—not just companies or software, but dreams, hopes and legacies.

But building isn’t just about creating tangible things. It’s about the intangibles too. It’s about building bridges between cultures, fostering understanding in a divided world and crafting friendships that stand the test of time. It’s about building a life that resonates with purpose, passion and authenticity.

Your time, like sand in an hourglass, is finite. Don't let it slip away living a life being confined by the boundaries of conventional thinking. The world is filled with opinions and judgments. Amidst that noise, find your melody, your unique rhythm. Because that inner voice, that quiet whisper, holds the blueprint of your true path.

Embrace the bravery to heed that voice, to chart a course steered by your heart and guided by your intuition. They possess the remarkable ability to lead you to your destiny, to the life you are meant to build.

So, before you walk through those halls of PICC today and step out into the world, armed with knowledge, passion and dreams, I challenge you: Build. Build with purpose, with love, with integrity. Whether it's a ground breaking innovation, a bridge of understanding or a bond of friendship, ensure it stands tall, echoing the essence of who you are and the difference you wish to make.

Because, in the end, it's not merely about the structures we raise, but the heart and soul we pour into them. Let your mark on this world be one of depth, of purpose and of legacy. Everything else is, indeed, secondary.

Congratulations, Class of 2023!

The canvas of the world is stretched out before you, awaiting your masterpiece. Embark on your journey and build things that resonate, build things that endure and build things that truly matter.
