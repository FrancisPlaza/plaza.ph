In 1995, Bill Gates appeared on *The Late Show with David Letterman* to talk about the internet. It was still a new concept to most people. Gates explained that you'd be able to listen to a baseball game on your computer, or read the news online. Letterman, with a bit of sarcasm, replied, “Does radio ring a bell?” The audience laughed. At the time, the internet felt like a solution looking for a problem. Why bother with the web when the radio already worked?

We know how that story turned out.

Today, the internet isn't something we think about. It’s something we rely on. It has reshaped everything, from how we work and learn to how we talk to each other and get things done. What felt confusing or unnecessary at first became a normal part of life. So normal, in fact, that we barely notice it anymore.

Electric vehicles are going through the same growing pains. And just like the internet back then, a lot of the questions today sound like we're still stuck in the past.

People ask: *How far can it go? What if I run out of battery? Where will I charge?* These are valid concerns, but they’re also missing the point. Focusing only on batteries or range is like judging the internet by how fast a dial-up connection loads a webpage in 1995.

We need to see EVs not as a replacement for gas cars, but as a step into a better way of moving people. When the first automobiles were introduced, people didn't get it either. Why trade your reliable horse for something expensive, noisy and unreliable? It took time. It took belief. But eventually, the car changed everything.

Henry Ford once said that if he had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. People naturally think in terms of what they already know. And it takes a shift in mindset to see that a whole new way of doing things is even possible.

That’s where we are with EVs.

Driving electric is not just about saving on fuel. It's about rethinking how our cities sound, how our skies look and how we power our lives. It's about using energy more wisely and making our homes, cars and communities work better together. A car that can update itself overnight, that doesn't need oil changes, that runs quietly without polluting the air—these are not small improvements. These are signs that the technology is maturing into something much bigger.

But we won't get there by accident. We have to help more people understand what this shift is about. That means educating drivers, supporting mechanics and workers in the transition and making sure no one is left behind. We need to stop treating EVs like luxury items or future dreams. They're here now, and they make sense today—not just for the rich or the eco-conscious, but for anyone who wants to live smarter and drive cleaner.

It's about time to stop asking how far an EV can go and start asking how far we're willing to go to build a future that makes sense—for the planet, for our cities, and for the generations that will inherit both.

Just like the internet eventually disappeared into the background of daily life, EVs will too. They’ll just be the way we drive. Quiet. Clean. Connected. Ordinary.

But that only happens if we stop asking the old questions and start seeing the bigger picture.

This isn’t just about batteries. It’s about moving forward together.
