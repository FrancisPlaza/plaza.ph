We're told to be patient. Plans are underway, budgets are signed, renderings look impressive. Then the rain comes and the neighbourhood learns the truth: the projects were real only in the brochure.

This isn't a weather story. It's governance dressed as flood control. We perform delivery instead of delivering it. Hearings chase headlines. Portals overflow with links and data no one can audit. Contractors appear when cameras roll and disappear when the water does not.

I'm not asking for less accountability. I want the real thing. Accountability that names names, recovers money and jails thieves. Accountability that publishes contracts, unit costs and change orders. Consequences, not captions.

Let's say the quiet part aloud. Public works that serve one family first are not public works. A "project of the year" that never breaks ground is theft in slow motion. A riverwall that exists only in a spreadsheet is not a mistake. It is a choice.

We've also given the grift a platform. Influencers launder incompetence as inevitability. Officials mistake content for governance. When people call it out, the reply is predictable: *inggit daw* or "political attack". No. This isn't envy. It's accountability. Silence makes us complicit.

Yet anger alone won't lower the waterline. Results will. Measure success the way ordinary people do after a storm: fewer flooded homes, faster drainage, roads that remain roads. Publish everything. Contracts, geotagged progress, as-built drawings, lab tests, to name a few. Freeze payments to firms that ghost hearings. Blacklist repeat offenders. File cases, not press releases.

Now the part we often dodge: us. We put them there. We sign the contract with our ballots. Every time we trade a vote for a few hundred pesos or a sack of ayuda, we borrow from our own pockets and pay it back with interest—through missed classes, ruined stock, lost wages. Vote-buying is not kindness. It's an advance on the next theft. If we keep selling our vote, we keep buying the flood.

We pretend this is an act of God. It is not. It is an act of government.

Remember that the bill is paid elsewhere. A mother wades through waist-deep water because the dike exists only in a spreadsheet. A student misses class because the school budget funded a press conference. A farmer sells at a loss because the subsidy arrived as a photo-op. We call this "delivery", but what we deliver are excuses.

We have to learn. Stop rewarding people who sell excuses for clicks. Stop treating political relief as personal generosity. Choose leaders who publish the work, not just the ribbon. Choose platforms that interrogate, not entertain. If a candidate cannot show transparent costs, independent tests and on-time delivery, they should not be anywhere near a budget.

I don't care which camp claims reform this week. I care whether the waterline is lower after the next storm. I care whether ghost projects can still invoice the treasury. I care whether those who stole public money face court, not cameras.

Let's end the theatrics. Let's end the shadow-boxing dressed as statesmanship. Let's end using public works as a family trust. If politics must perform, let it perform competence. Publish the work, meet the deadlines, stand by the results. Save the applause for neighbourhoods that stay dry.

In the end, flood control is a ballot decision as much as an engineering one. We can choose spectacle, or we can choose safety. We can sell the future cheap, or we can vote like the water is already rising—because it is.

Until we demand that reform, we will keep drowning in concrete and excuses, front-row seats to a spectacle that costs us our future.
