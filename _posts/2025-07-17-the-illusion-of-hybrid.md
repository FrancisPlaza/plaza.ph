When people think of shifting to electric vehicles in the Philippines, many believe hybrids or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are the practical middle ground. A compromise between the old and the new. A safe transition.

But what if I told you that conventional hybrids and PHEVs aren't a step forward at all? That they're a clever illusion created by legacy automakers who couldn't, or wouldn't, let go of their old ways?

At face value, hybrids sound like progress. A bit of electric, a bit of fuel. Cleaner, supposedly. But let's look closer. Hybrids are, in essence, a band-aid solution. They were born not out of innovation, but hesitation. They're the car industry's attempt to cling to internal combustion, wrapped in the narrative of "environmentally friendly". In reality, most hybrids still rely heavily on petrol. The small battery inside serves as a supplement, not a replacement. It's still an oil-dependent machine.

Now, PHEVs promise more. You can charge them, you can drive short distances on electric power. Sounds great, right? Until you realise you're buying a Frankenstein of two half-systems: a small, underpowered battery and an outdated combustion engine. Not only do they carry the cost and complexity of both, but they rarely deliver the full benefits of either. Some PHEV owners even exclusively use their batteries on a regular basis. The result? A small, short-range electric car dragging around the dead weight of an unused combustion engine.

In the Philippine context, this is particularly concerning. Walk into any showroom today and you'll find PHEVs being marketed as "green" or "eco-friendly". But these vehicles still emit carbon, still burn petrol, and often mislead well-intentioned buyers into thinking they're making a clean choice.

And then there's behaviour. In cities like Manila, where public charging infrastructure is still limited, PHEVs are starting to clog charging stations. It's not uncommon to see PHEVs plugged in for hours to recharge their tiny batteries, preventing full battery EVs, which actually depend on charging, from accessing what little infrastructure exists. It's a small detail, but it reveals a bigger problem: when we sell people compromises, we encourage compromised behaviour.

To be fair, the bigger issue isn't the individual choices of PHEV drivers—most of whom simply want to reduce fuel costs or drive cleaner. The problem is structural. It's the direct result of policy gaps and market loopholes.

The way government policy around EV incentives have been crafted in the Philippines has allowed this narrative to flourish. Instead of pushing for true electrification, we've created an environment where carmakers can dump hybrids and PHEVs onto the market, claiming progress while barely moving the needle. Capitalism, left unchecked, always optimises for profit—not sustainability.

Take EVIDA as a case in point. The law was intended to promote the adoption of EVs through tax incentives and perks like coding exemptions. But here's what happened instead: major manufacturers (and newcomers alike) flooded the market with hybrids and PHEVs—vehicles that, under the current wording of the law, still qualify for certain benefits like coding exemptions. These weren't battery electric vehicles. They weren't zero-emission. But because the law didn't differentiate between hybrid types and full EVs, the spirit of the incentive was lost. What should have been a push towards cleaner transport became a backdoor for legacy brands to extend the life of their combustion technologies.

This isn't accidental. It's malicious compliance—a calculated response by automakers to exploit an incomplete law. Instead of encouraging the market to evolve, we handed manufacturers a way to continue selling what's easiest and most profitable, dressed up in green branding.

Here's the hard truth: if we're serious about electrification in the Philippines, we can't afford half-steps. We need policy that clearly favours battery electric vehicles: real zero-emission cars. We need public education that explains why hybrids are not the answer. We need charging infrastructure built for BEVs, not PHEVs, and tax incentives that reward choosing the cleaner, simpler solution.

Skipping hybrids might sound bold. But it's the only way forward. Other countries are learning this lesson fast. China, the world's largest EV market, is already phasing out incentives for hybrids to focus purely on battery EVs. Europe is tightening emission rules that will make PHEVs obsolete by the end of the decade.

The Philippines doesn't need to repeat their mistakes. We have the chance to leapfrog, to skip the compromise and build for the future, not the past.

Let's not settle for vehicles that pretend to be clean. Let's drive real change. And that means driving electric, all the way.
